player_npc1_player_1: 'Hi NPC1, how are you feeling today?',

player_npc1_npc1_1: 'Not so good. Since yesterday I have been vomiting and have diarrhea. ' +
											'I also have been very thirsty, but I\'m sure I\'ll be better in a ' + 
											'day or two.',

player_npc1_player_2: 'Oh no! Have you come in contact with the monster lately?',

player_npc1_npc1_2: 'Well I did see him while I was fishing a couple of days ago, but ' + 
											'he was on the other side of the river. He seemed harmless to me.',
 
player_npc1_player_3: 'What else happened while you were fishing?',


player_npc1_npc1_3: 'Well not much, I didn\'t catch a single fish. But I did forget my ' + 
											'water at home, so I took a drink from the river when I got thirsty.',

player_npc1_player_4: 'Well it sounds like you have the same sickness that most of the town ' +
										'has been getting. I talked to the doctor, and he said this is very serious! ' + 
										'You need to go see him right away!',

player_npc1_npc1_4: 'Oh dear! Okay I\'ll go over right now. Thanks PLAYER!',


// conversation with NPC2
player_npc2_player_1: 'Hi NPC2, what have you been up to lately?',

player_npc2_npc2_1: 'I haven\'t had much time today to leave the house, because I\'ve been ' + 
									'care of my sister. She isn\'t feeling so well.',

player_npc2_player_2: 'What\'s wrong?',

player_npc2_npc2_2: 'She says her stomach hurts, and her body feels sore. She also can\'t stop ' +
									'drinking water.',

player_npc2_player_3: 'Has she had any diarrhea or vomited at all?',

player_npc2_npc2_3: 'She did last night, but it went away this morning so she must be getting better.',

player_npc2_player_4: 'I spoke with the doctor today and he told me that other people in town ' +
										'have been having these symptoms too. You need to take her to the doctor ' + 
										'right away, because if she gets too dehydrated she could die.',

player_npc2_npc2_4: 'I had no idea! I\'ll take her right now. Thanks!',

// conversation after both patients have been recommended.

player_doctor_doctor_1: 'Thanks for telling NPC1 and NPC2 to come see me, they\'re being taken ' + 
												'care of right now and should be okay soon. If they had waited any ' + 
												'longer they might not have made it.'
